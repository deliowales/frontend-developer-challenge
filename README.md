## Fruit Book üçá

We'd like to know more about the food we eat, starting with fruit. We know we should be eating more, but what?!

## Requirements üóÉÔ∏è

- Fork this repository.
- Using [FruityVice](https://www.fruityvice.com), develop a table that presents all available types of fruit.
- Data shouldn't load automatically, fetch the data on button press ‚Äì a "Populate Fruit Book" button.
- We have provided an rough HTML scaffold ‚Äì replace this HTML with your own design and [antd](https://ant.design/) components.
- Style it appropriately, have fun with it and show off your design skills.
- The tables should be sortable with appropriate columns based on the data.

## Bonus points ü•á

- We would really like to search Fruit Book in real time. By entering characters into a search box, the list of fruit should begin filtering as the user types.
- Show us your skills with React's Hooks.
- Use TypeScript.
- Break your work into commits, showing progress and an understanding of GitHub.
- Write unit tests or at the very least, implement snapshot testing.
- Deploy it to a static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify etc).

## How to submit

- Share a link to a public or private repository on GitHub.
